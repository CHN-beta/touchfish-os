# What is this?

This is an overlay of [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/), including stuff I need but not available or outdated in other
overlays.

Unlike [lazychn](https://github.com/CHN-beta/lazychn), this overlay is prepared for other users, not just me. I will try
to keep packages here up to date and fix any issues as soon as possible.

# License

I am not familiar with open-source licenses. I choose GPL-v3 arbitrarily, but if it is not compatible with something,
please let me know.
